To install Narrow boards there are a couple of possibilities

**1) For Windows users: automatic install**

* Download https://github.com/mrguen/644-1284-Narrow/blob/master/install/MightyCore-Pandauino.exe
* And execute. The installer is not signed so it is normal if you get a warning. It will
  - Install the boards definitions in you local sketch/hardware folder
  - Install the CH340 driver (close the driver installer if it is already installed)
  
**2) Manual install for Windows and other systems**

See the user's manual https://github.com/mrguen/644-1284-Narrow/tree/master/doc 
"INSTALLATION" section
